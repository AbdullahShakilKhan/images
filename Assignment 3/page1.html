    <h2>1) Hunza Valley</h2>
    <p>Located in Gilgit Baltistan, the Hunza Valley is one of Pakistan’s hidden gems. This isolated valley is nestled
        between the Himalayas and the Karakoram mountain peaks. This is one of the best places to visit in Pakistan
        because of its lush farmlands. Here you can find markhors, ounces, ibexes, and red foxes. In this valley, a
        glorious view awaits you, and the locals are warm and friendly.</p>
